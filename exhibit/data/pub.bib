	abstract = {Emerging of very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (vvIBDV) genotype in poultry ﬂocks in Morocco were characterized. VP2 sequence analysis showed that the strains of Moroccan vvIBDV genotypes clustered separately from classic and vaccine strains reference of IBDV. The full-length genome of four Moroccan vvIBDV strains was determined, in order to get a more exhaustive molecular characterization allowing to conduct the evolution time scale and speculations on their origin. In a phylogenetic tree, nucleotide sequences of segment A and B formed a common branch with those vvIBDV references strains published in GenBank, but they clearly grouped into a distinct subcluster. An alignment of deduced amino acid sequences segment B, conﬁrmed the presence of the conserved TDN tripeptide found in all of the vvIBDV genotype and revealed the presence of 2 substitutions I472L and E688D speciﬁc for the vvIBDV Moroccan isolates. The deduced amino acid sequences of segment A genes showed the presence of the “signature” typical of the vvIBDV genotype and revealed the presence of 7 aa substitutions speciﬁc for the vvIBDV Moroccan strains. The evolution rate for IBDV VP2 gene was estimated at 5.875 × 10−4 substitutions/site/year. The estimation of the time to most common recent ancestor of Moroccan vvIBDV based on the VP2 sequences available was 31 years, corresponding to 3 years earlier than the ﬁrst vvIBDV case detection in layers in the country.},

Adverse effects of vaccination such as local inflammation at the injection site and localized or generalized skin lesions in some vaccinated animals have been reported with live vaccines. The aim of this work was to compare the safety of two lumpy skin disease (LSD) vaccine strains, Kenyan (Kn) Sheep and Goat Pox (KSGP O-240) and LSDV Neethling (Nt) strain, and to determine the etiology of the post-vaccination (pv) reactions observed in cattle. Experimental cattle were vaccinated under controlled conditions with Nt- and KSGP O-240-based vaccines, using two different doses, and animals were observed for 3 months for any adverse reactions. Three out of 45 cattle vaccinated with LSDV Nt strain (6.7\%) and three out of 24 cattle vaccinated with Kn strain (12.5\%) presented LSD-like skin nodules, providing evidence that the post-vaccination lesions may not be strain-dependent. Lesions appeared 1–3 weeks after vaccination and were localized in the neck or covering the whole body. Animals recovered after 3 weeks. There is a positive correlation between the vaccine dose and the appearance of skin lesions in vaccinated animals; at the 105 dose, 12\% of the animals reacted versus 3.7\% at the 104 dose. Both strains induced solid immunity when protection was measured by neutralizing antibody seroconversion.},

	abstract = {Invasive pathogens can be a threat when they affect human health, food production or ecosystem services, by displacing resident species, and we need to understand the cause of their establishment. We studied the patterns and causes of the establishment of the pathogen Dickeya solani that recently invaded potato agrosystems in Europe by assessing its invasion dynamics and its competitive ability against the closely related resident D. dianthicola species. Epidemiological records over one decade in France revealed the establishment of D. solani and the maintenance of the resident D. dianthicola in potato fields exhibiting blackleg symptoms. Using experimentations, we showed that D. dianthicola caused a higher symptom incidence on aerial parts of potato plants than D. solani, while D. solani was more aggressive on tubers (i.e. with more severe symptoms). In co-infection assays, D. dianthicola outcompeted D. solani in aerial parts, while the two species co-existed in tubers. A comparison of 76 D. solani genomes (56 of which have been sequenced here) revealed balanced frequencies of two previously uncharacterized alleles, VfmBPro and VfmBSer, at the vfmB virulence gene. Experimental inoculations showed that the VfmBSer population was more aggressive on tubers, while the VfmBPro population outcompeted the VfmBSer population in stem lesions, suggesting an important role of the vfmB virulence gene in the ecology of the pathogens. This study thus brings novel insights allowing a better understanding of the pattern and causes of the D.solani invasion into potato production agrosystems, and the reasons why the endemic D. dianthicola nevertheless persisted.},

	abstract = {Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is one of the most expensive spices in the world. Saffron has many uses, which are based on color, aroma, and taste. This spice is mainly used in food industry and in kitchen as a food dye. It is also used as a drug in traditional medicine. In this study, genetic diversity among 76 saffron accessions collected from 13 localities of Taliouin region of Morocco, were evaluated using sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. A total of 63 polymorphic fragments were produced with an average of total number and polymorphic bands per primer were 10.5 and 10.16 respectively. Most of the variations among the 13 localities, revealed by Analysis of Molecular Variance, originated from the within accessions differentiation (81 \%; p{\textless}0.010). Cluster Analysis, Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), and Population Structure confirmed the main groups and corroborated genetic homogeneity across accessions. In fact, despite their geographical localities, close relationships were revealed between accessions from different locations, showing that there was no relationship between genetic divergence and geographical locality. The results confirmed that the SRAP markers seam more trustworthy, as they have the highest average discriminating power among the other marker systems.},

	abstract = {Pectobacterium brasiliense (Pbr) is considered as one of the most virulent species among the Pectobacteriaceae. This species has a broad host range within horticulture crops and is well distributed elsewhere. It has been found to be pathogenic not only in the field causing blackleg and soft rot of potato, but it is also transmitted via storage causing soft rot of other vegetables. Genomic analysis and other cost-effective molecular detection methods such as a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are essential to investigate the ecology and pathogenesis of the Pbr. The lack of fast, field deployable point-of-care testing (POCT) methods, specific control strategies and current limited genomic knowledge make management of this species difficult. Thus far, no comprehensive review exists about Pbr, however there is an intense need to research the biology, detection, pathogenicity and management of Pbr, not only because of its fast distribution across Europe and other countries but also due to its increased survival to various climatic conditions. This review outlines the information available in peer-reviewed literature regarding host range, detection methods, genomics, geographical distribution, nomenclature and taxonomical evolution along with some of the possible management and control strategies. In summary, the conclusions and a further directions highlight the management of this species.},

	url = {https://f1000research.com/articles/7-1310/v2},
	doi = {10.12688/f1000research.15719.2},
	abstract = {Background:
              The Argane tree (
              Argania spinosa
              L. Skeels) is an endemic tree of mid-western Morocco that plays an important socioeconomic and ecologic role for a dense human population in an arid zone. Several studies confirmed the importance of this species as a food and feed source and as a resource for both pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds. Unfortunately, the argane tree ecosystem is facing significant threats from environmental changes (global warming, over-population) and over-exploitation. Limited research has been conducted, however, on argane tree genetics and genomics, which hinders its conservation and genetic improvement.
            
            
              Methods:
              Here, we present a draft genome assembly of
              A. spinosa
              . A reliable reference genome of 
              A. spinosa
               was created using a hybrid 
              de novo
              assembly approach combining short and long sequencing reads.
            
            
              Results:
              In total, 144 Gb Illumina HiSeq reads and 7.6 Gb PacBio reads were produced and assembled. The final draft genome comprises 75 327 scaffolds totaling 671 Mb with an N50 of 49 916 kb. The draft assembly is close to the genome size estimated by
              k
              -mers distribution and covers 89\% of complete and 4.3 \% of partial
              Arabidopsis
              orthologous groups in BUSCO.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              The
              A. spinosa
              genome will be useful for assessing biodiversity leading to efficient conservation of this endangered endemic tree. Furthermore, the genome may enable genome-assisted cultivar breeding, and provide a better understanding of important metabolic pathways and their underlying genes for both cosmetic and pharmacological.},

The aim of the present work was to study the genetic diversity and the population structure of isolates belonging to sect. Alternaria obtained from infected citrus fruits, collected from seven provinces at different locations in Morocco (markets, packinghouses, and orchards). Forty-five isolates were analyzed by sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers, and cluster analysis of DNA fragments was performed using UPGMA method and Jaccard coefficient. Cluster analysis revealed that isolates were classified in four distinct groups. AMOVA revealed also a large extent of variation within sect. Alternaria isolates (99\%). The results demonstrate that no correlation was found among SRAP pattern, host, and geographical origin of these isolates. Population structure analyses showed that the Alternaria isolates from the same collection origin had almost a similar level of admixture.},
